# Todo List for osgModeling 0.2.0 #

  * The subdivision classes, which help subdivide simple polygons into complex and smooth ones. It is just opposite with the osgUtil::Simplifier.

  * The plugin for reading/outputing surface data.

  * Hermite method for Bezier curves, and even more.

  * Torus, Paraboloid and Platonic surfaces, and even more.

  * Planning for a better UV wrapper instead of current naive one. :)

  * Planning for the real-time controling of surface control points, which leads to some morph animations.
